# Note
still working...

In this post, Fast-SCNN (fast segmentation convolutional neural network) is briefly reviewed.
This architecture aims on real-time semantic segmentation tasks, and it can reach 123.5 frames
per second on Cityscapes dataset with a high resolution of input image (1024 x 2048 px).

# Outline
- Fast-SCNN architecture overview
- Experiment Results

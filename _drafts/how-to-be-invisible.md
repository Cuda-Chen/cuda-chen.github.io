## Chapter 1 How This Book Can Make You Invisible

### four levels of privacy

#### level one

Very basic, ecomoical moves that will give you more privacy tha 98 percent of other people.

#### level two

You utilities, your smartphones, and your other electronic devices will be in
alternate names. The license plates on your vehicles will not reveal your true name and address.
Anything confidential will be shredded.

#### level three

This will almost certainly require a move from your present location. Both your home (or
rental property) and your vehicles will be in the names of annonymous limited liability companies
(LLCs). Your home address will now be hidden from all but your closest relatives and friends.
What's more, your home address will no longer appear annual tax returns, or anywhere else.
You Internet/e-mail connections will be under cover if you follow the directions in chapter 12
, "E-mail and the Internet".

> Comments by myself: to this level you may not benefit from the service of current society
> such as credit cards and loans. Think twice before to this level.

#### level four

A dulication of the federal Witness Security Program fro criminals protected by the U.S.
government (of course it is illegal if you do this by your own).

> Comments by myself: you WILL give up all the benefits from nowadays society and you
> have no choice but ot keep running as the PI (private investigators) will find you if PI are willing to pay
> for unlimited resources.

#### advice by the author

- Start working on Level One even before you finish reading this book.
- In the weeks and months to come, raise yourself to Level Two.
- Raise to Level Three if you want to have fun.

### how to use this book

- ***Do not skip the next chapter.***
- You journey must begin with the first step: *seperating your name from your home address*.

## Chapter 2 Sepearate Your Name From Your Home Address

### take this immediate step to protect your mail

1. If your presently have a PO box, choose that address.
2. Have it sent on to your place of business if you have one, or perhaps to a friend who is in business.
3. Rent a box at a commercial mail-receving agency (CMRA).
4. Obtain a ghost address (of which more will be said later) in some faraway state or country and have the mail sent there.

### notes by me

- Though more and more services (such as third-party electrical payment service)
require an actual address, using a PO/CMRA box will still be a great idea as it
can seperate yourself and your living address.
- To receive goods or some formal mails such as lawsuit form, using a ghost
seems the first choice (though you may spend much more money as we need to
create an environment to let others to believe you actually lives in the
address).

## Chapter 3 When Is a "Lie" Not a Lie?

> A Lie is a false statement made by one to another, who is entitled to hear
> and know the truth, and which false statement tends toward injury to the other.

> For author's guidelines:
> 1. Where no harm will be done, and no sworn oath is involved, I often give
> incurrect information. So does my wife.
> 2. I never give incorrect information if I am to sign a sworn statement,
> whether or not before a notary.
> 3. I may *withhold* information from the police or from government
> representative but I won't lie to them.
> 4. Under no condition whatsoever will I file a false tax return.

## Chapter 4 Mailboxes, Public and Private

Definition of public and private mailboxes:

- public: the boxes you can rent at a government postal service.
- private: commerical mail-receiving agencies (CMRAs).

### post-office boxes

If a choice is availabel, rent a box as far away from your home as is convenient for picking up mail once or twice a week. The ideal situation--often the case if you have a long commute to work--is to have the box in another town.

#### advantages

- First and formost, you avoid having to give out your street address.
- If you move to another location in the same area, there will be no changes to make for incoming mail.
- Your mail will be safe from thieves, no matter how long you leave it in the box.
- When you are on vacation, mail will not pile up at the mailbox at your home--a clear singla that the occupants are away.

#### disadvantages

- The process you have to go through such as filling forms with your legal name.

#### if you simply cannot move, ever

Rent a cheap apartment on a month-by-month basis, and live there just long enough to rent a box and have that address checked out. Then move back home, but *keep those rent receipts*.

> I have no idea about the "keep those rent receipts" means.
> Need to ask laywer in the future.

### other options for receiving mail at a PO box

If your friend or relative with the same last name, and he/she is agreeable, you could receive mail in their box. Most postal employees have more important duties than to check the first names of everyone in a family.

Another suggestion is to open the box in the name of a limited liability company (LLC), and here is the processes:

1. Rent a box in your own name, then you list your LLC.
2. Send yourself a few letters from time to time with address your LLC.
3. There may be no problem in receiving "your new name" even though the ending "LLC" is not included.

For total anonymity:

- Find someone whose mailbox you can take over. Either they are moving away or are poor enough so that a cash contribution will allow you to take over their box.
- Use this person's basic name--with a slight alteration--as if it were your own.

### commerical mail-receving agencies (CMRAS)

#### advantages

- Receive mail form private couriers and packages from PUS and FedEx.
- You will have a street address, which in some cases is necessary.
- You can often call in while traveling to have your mail sent on.
- They are often open longer.

#### disadvantages

- You will have to signa a "Private Mailbox (PMB) Rental Agreement" that includes a ea of small print. If an agent at the CMRA does not witness your signature, then it must be notarized.
- You will be required to furnish two from of identification such as photocopy of your picture.
- All major CMRA addresses are kept in commerical databases will may block in official use or order shipping from Internet.

#### possible remedies for private boxes

- Rent the box, then *move*, without telling the CMRA.
- Choose a mom-and-pop operation with a signle outlet.

### summary

If you do not plan to go beyond Level One security, get a private box at one of the CMRAs and have all your mail sent there.

For advanced security, however, the auther strongly suggest you to use a PO box if at all possible. What's more, let the PO box cannot connect you with your present home address. 

Use this box number for:

- Personal mail from relative and friends
- Bank statement
- Telephone, inscurance, and utility bills
- Social Security and Medicard (if applicable)
- Any other strictly personal mail

For everthing else--and especially if you receive mail in other names, use a private, alternate street address. This "ghost" address is the subject of the next chapter.

## Chapter 5 How to Obtain Your Own "Ghost" Address

A *ghost address* means to a fugure address you will use that is not in any database as a CMRA, and has no connection to where you really live.
What's more you may wish to have multiple ghost addresses.

### a partial list where alternate address will be used

1. The Internal Revenue Service.
2. Your driver's license.
3. All license for your pets (a PI's favorite search).
4. Hunting and fishing licenses.
5. Your voter's registration (if any).
6. Any membership records, such as with your church.
7. Your doctor, dentist, and chiropractor.
8. You attorney and accountant.
9. All LLCs used to title vehicles and real estate.
10. Cable TV (Another PI favorite! Make certain it's under another name).

### how to set up your own ghost address

#### older office building
An older office building which has several floors that neede renovation and had no tenants usually will fit your need. All the offices on those empty floors had mail slots in the doors. Even better, the building has multiple entrances on different streets and residentail aparment son the upper floors.

#### charity mission

> Charity missions, link the Salvation Army, often have people
> stay there for extended periods. They accept mail for residents
> so thay can get jobs, welfare, etc.

#### small motel

An independently run mom-and-pop motels may become your ghost
address if you dress well and pay them.

#### small-town pastor

> Give donation and get the address. Who's going to think about seeing what's in a small, unmarked box being shipped to a church?

### alternative sources for a ghost address

Check the Yelllow Pages for "Office Services," "Bookkeeping," etc.
Dont' call them, go in person. Discuss whatever service they offer, and then, as you're leaving, imitate the talk that whether it will be acceptable
to receive mail for any of your clients.

### should you allow anyone at your ghost address to know where you live?

Only you can answer that question. Hopefully, when you made the arrangements, you gave an address other than your own, and no telephone number. However, some PIs will make a deception to locate your address such as mocking himself as Fedex delivery.
There are two ways to protect yourself from this deception. One is to make sure that no one at your new address knows anything about you. The other is to use persons who, although they know you will positively protect you. If the latter, then amke sure to educate them about the various scams that may be used in an attempt to deceive them.

### now for the hard part

The hardest part of keeping your actual home address a secret is to educate your family to never, ever give out your home address to anyone other than relatives and close friends.

### your house number

If you delete the number on your house but still need to have others find it, you can tell your guests for a certain landmark or making some sign.

### a unique solution to hiding your home address

Buying a motor home under another name.

## Chapter 6. RepairMen, Home Deliveries, FedED, UPS

### obtaining consent to tneter by deception

Why invite strangers into your home? Just say no, and
give the location of the nearest pay phone. Or you may
use the following two excuses:

1. "My husband tells me never to allow strangers into
the hose when he's not here".
2. "All we have is a cell phone and I lent it to my
father today.

### courier services such as FedEx and UPS

The only sure way to avoid having someone send you an
envelope or a package by courier is to never, ever,
let any other than your closest friends know where you
really live.

#### home delivery

Never allow your true name to be coupled with a delivery
to your home. If you feel that it is imperative to have
a delivery mode to where you really live, *it must not
be in your name*.

If, in fact, you have *ever* received a letter or package
at your present address under your real name, the only
way to protect your privacy is to move. Once this move
has bee made,then any futhre delivery must be in another
name. When you sign for the delivery, sign your *other*
name.
However, keep in mind for tex problem.

What's more, you may let the senders sign on the line of "
Release Signature. Sign to authorize delivery without 
obtaining signature", and when you see the FedEx truck
arrive, do not answer the door.

> My comment: this usuall won't be the case as
> there is no delivery option for Release Signature.

For picking up your goods at delivery office,
usually is not a good idea as the company requires
you to show your true name.

#### mail drop pickup

You can normally receive a shipment in CMRA (even though
you have not rented a box at the CMRA) in a business name
and no ID is necessary.

The following shows how to works:

1. You are going to send a small box.
2. You request your "friend to make a phone call to ask FedEx
or UPS whether it is acceptable to receive the box that
a "salesperson" will pick the box up and the reciver will be
your other names.
3. You then call your "friend"

### robber may intersonate the police

### pizza deliveries

Just no pizza deliveries.

### if your home address is already known, move

### note after reading chapter 6

1. As there are plenty of receiver proxy services
in the wild, is it possilbe to adopt these services
to receive your goods?

## Chapter 7 Untraeable Trash, Anonymous Utilities

### what yoru trash reveals about you

- bank statements
- telephone bills
- utility and other bills
- credit card and ATM receipts
- paycheck
- empty bottles for prescription medicine (with your doctor's name)
- personal and business letters; all address labels
- scraps of paper revealing a phone number or e-mail address.
- beer cans, wine, and liquor bottles
- anything to indicate drug use
- itemize grocery and pharmacy slips
- classfied ads from newspapers (to see if anything is circled)
- magazines, travel newspapers, or anything that would indicate interest in weapons or strange practices.

### utilities

For this book utilities means the companies that furnish electricity, grabage pickup, water and sewer connections, and natural or propane gas.

Never give yoru true name--much less your Social Seuciryt number or date of birth!--to a utility company, nor to any other private company that will furnish a service at yoru actual residence.

Rather, you should give your name as a fictitious one, or use your wife's madien name. Even then, this should just be her middle initial plus last name.
If the home is in the name of a limited liability company (see chapter 15), give each company the name of the LLC and insist that the name in the compny database is in the name of the LLC only.

A quick-and-dirty method of setting the utility accounts on short notice is to use a nominee (proxy), some who will act on yoru behalf (see chapter 13).For demanding a cash deposit for checking your credit, you can use a money order or a bank check for a deposit. Give them you "ghost" address (see chapter 5), explaining that (a) you do not have a mailbox at the street address, and (b) all bills are paid from your "business" (ghost) address.

### notes after reading chapter 7

- use cross shred to shred information

## Chapter 8 Your Social Security Number and Date of Birth

### your date of birth (DOB)

No matter how common your name, you can be quickly identified
in a database by coupling either your name *or* your birth date with your address.

If filling in a form yourself, you can just write "legal age". Anotehr alternatives is to
give a fictitious month and day, and a year a bit before or after the real one.
If you felel boligated to give a a date of birth, choose one that is easy to remember,
such as a national holiday.

### your social security number (SSN)

If you are asked for your SSN by any federal, state, or local government agency,
look for the Privacy Act Statuement. If it isn't there, ask to seeit before you give your number.

### your driver's license (DL)

Let's consider some of these private agencies or organizations:

#### your employer's demand for your DL, DOB, and SSN

- The ideal employer is you yourself.
- When you work for wages, tell the employer you will give 
your SSN if and when actually hired for the job.
- Do all within your power to give your employer only your
ghost address.
- Working as an independant contractor may be a great idea
yet you should consult a CPA.

#### hospitals and doctors

Remember, when a PI has an associate search for your records
in the Medical Information Bureau, many identical names
may come up. His first choice for picking you out will be
your date of birth, and his second choice will be whatever
address he may have for you (if any).

For nervous disorder, psychiatric problem, or sexually transmitted
disease, you should pay cash and use a false name. Better
yet, pop over into Canada and Mexico.

#### banks

Always use passport for identification.

#### renting an apartment

- Give all but not SSN.
- Dress well, be polite, use your passport for ID,
and offer to pay several months in advance.
  - Above all, prepare beforehand to explain the reason--perhaps
fear of a stalker--why you are simply unabel to allow any to have your SSN.
  - If you must furnish a copy of your tax return, black out
your SSN, and then (to make sure it cannot still be read
in front of a strong light) make a copy of that copy.
- If, at the present time, you see no way around acceding
to all of the landlord's demands, do not despair. Get a
short lease or rent month-by-month while you make your plans
to move on to a more private location.
- *Warning:* If you succeed in renting an apartment without
revealign your SSN, then never pay the rent with a personal check.
Insteal, pay either in cash or with a money order purchased
at a post office, a supermarket, or a convenience store.

#### renting a hose from its owner

Refer to *renting an apartment* section.

#### traver trailers and mobile homes

You may buy an older mobile home in a park and then fixing ti up while you live there.

#### real estate purchases and sales

- One is to never actually buy real estate.
- You can instead purchase and sell in the name of
a New Mexico limited liability company if you first
obtain a tax identification number (TIN).

#### false social security numbers

- Usually not a good idea.
- You give your true number but only when absolutely required,
or else no number at all.

#### obtaining credit

- If you want to be invisible, just don't obtain any personal credit.

#### run your life on a cash basis

If you truly wish to become invisible, never apply for personal credit.
(There is occasionally a business exception but credit in this case
should be extended only to your corporation or LLC).

### notes after reading chapter 8

- As some countries heavily utilize the SSN and eventually SSN leaks out in any scenes,
consider an alternative to against showing the SSN.
- Always showing your passport.
  - However, passport of some countries show SSN and date of birth,
consider an alternative of showing the passport.
- In some countries, obtaining credits is crucial for you to live,
consider an alternative to address this.

## Chapter 9 Your Alternate Names and Signatures

### if you say it's your signature, then it's your signature

- You can use any number of different signatures, including illegible ones.

### an alternate name

### titles

- DO NOT give advice.
- It is permissible to act the part.

### medical records

- Do tno give the doctor a complete medical history.
- Change your birht date and withhold your SSN lest for nessarity.
- Get off voter rolls and never return.

### web sites advertising fake ID

***Just don't use these services at all.***

## Chapter 10 Landline Telephones and Answering Machines

### telephone security

"Telephone security" is an oxymoron because a telephone conversation is never secure.

### unlisted numbers

An unlisted number is no longer the protection it used to be.
Many unlisted telephone numbers are now available on the Internet, and
reverse searches are available as well.

### how to list your name

Given that the name you give the telling company may show up on a database, do
your best to disguist it and try with the following methods:

- Wife's middle name and maiden name.
- Your middle name or initial, and last name.
- The name of a friend or relative (with a very common name) who is willing to have the phone
put in their middle/last or middle/maiden names.

Another system is to explain that your are a writer and that your telephone
number must be listed in your well-known *pen*. name.

If moving to a new area, I'd first spend an hour
or two with the local telephone directory, checking for the most
common names in the area.

### how not to answer the telephone

- A smple "Hello" or "Good moring" will suffice.
- Pratice beforehand.

### changing your listing

If your are not yet willing or able to move to new location, you
may still contact the telephone company to say your are moving
away.

Then, after few days or weeks later, order a new telephone, which will
of course have a different number. If you areusing someone else
to do this for your, have him or her make the call. This person will
*not* admit to having had service before, nor will a SSN be given.

Next, play the payment with cash deposit, and pay your bills on time.

### cordless phones

Usually don't use this as your comminucation is always compromised.

### the telephone at the other end

When you make a sensitive call, make sure the person at the
other end is on a secure line, or just meet him/her in person.

### "hacker-proof" answering machines

There is no such thing, period.

### calls to 911

When you call 911, your true address shows up on the operator's
monitor, along with whatevern name your telephone service is
under.

You can use the following three techniques:

1. Use a cell phone to call to 911.
2. Call a friend who will in turn call 911 from his/her home.
3. Give your ghost address, adding that you are just housesitting
for a friend when the emergency came up.

### watch our for this sneaky trick

When a call comes in from a sensitive party, and
there is some confusion about who called whom, *ask*. if neither
called the other, you have just had a heads up that someone is
after one or both of you.

### questions

- In the case of a life-or-death situation where neither privacy
nor legality matter, what is the fastest way to get help?
  - Call tierh the fire department or 911 and report a fire in prog-
ress.
  - "At a time like this you can't really worry about legal niceties. There's
not much point in being completely law-abiding if you're dead."

When I was browsing PTT BBS one month ago, I noticed a post about establishing a Slack
group aiming to practice on well-known dataset. After reading the post, I think I can
make some side projects on these famous dataset. What's more, I can meet some friends
and get some great ideas of feature engineering and model selection when I am running 
machine learning projects in the future.

## Aim of This Series
This series will go through the datasets with respect to their input features as well 
as charateristics. Also, I will show my steps to undergo these dataset and my model's
performance. 

Stay tuned for my posts in the next few months!

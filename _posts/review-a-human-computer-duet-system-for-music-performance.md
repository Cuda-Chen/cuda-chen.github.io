In this post, **A Human-Computer Duet System for Music Performance**, by
Academia Sinica, is reviewed. In this paper:
- **A virtual violinist** is created who can perform chamber music with
a human pianist that **does not need any intervention**.
- The proposed system **has performed in a public concert**.
- Discussions of effective improvement of the system is presented.

This work is supported by the Automatic Music Concert Animation (AMCA) project
of the Institute.

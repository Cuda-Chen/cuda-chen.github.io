Some of the Jekyll theme lack of comment system, as a result, we have to add plugin
to fulfill this task, and [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) is recommended by many people

some problems adding Disqus, so I write this guide to teach you Minima users to install
Disqus with no any problem.


Let's gtet started!

## Introduction
In nowdays, when we develop a web application, we usually apply CI (Continuous
Integration) and CD (Continous Deployment) to automate the processes of testing
and deployment.

To run such automations, we use Jenkins [^1] and Travis [^2] in the old days.
However, in this decade, there are lots of tool popping up for our needs, and
one of them is GitHub Actions. As a web developer and GitHub lovers, I would
like to use GitHub Actions for not only can be easily integrated with GitHub
projects but also show off my abaility to customize GitHub Actions for my needs.
Therefore, I would like to share my note apply GitHub Actions (especially CI)
on an example Django project using MySQL as its database.

## Motivation
Image segmentation plays a great role in order to realize which
objects construct an image. In order to reach this goal, people
have invented a lot of strategies -- one of which is superpixel.

SLIC is a well-known algorithm which runs in linear time complexity
, and has been implemented in various image processing libraries
including OpenCV and scikit-image. However, [JulaImages](
https://juliaimages.org/latest/) has not implemented SLIC yet,
though this Julia image processing package contains Felzenswalb
and quick shift. Therefore, I want to implmenet SLIC in Julia
to let me famlilar with SLIC algorithm but also Julia.

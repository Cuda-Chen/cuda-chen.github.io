## Motivation
When I started to take my master degree, my professor told me to implement
with pure C++ and CUDA. After working for two months, I eventually finished
the first version but the result seems blurry.

However, I learned how to use pointer and basic CUDA concepts in this project.
Also, I got some concepts of how a CNN work and its architecture. As a revenge, 
I want to implement SRCNN from scratch, and this post is talking
about the note when working on this project.

## What is Super Resolution?

## So What is SRCNN?

title: "Create a FFTW 3 Docker from Scratch"
category: [DevOps]
tags: [DevOps, Docker, FFTW]

## Motivation
The speed of FFTW is pretty amazing, but the installation is a little
bit complex. What's more, I want to try to build FFTW source code
from its GitHub repo rather than zip file, and I want a well-configured
environment on-the-go. Therefore, I create this project and learn
some basic about Docker.

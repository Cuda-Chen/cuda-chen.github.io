## Introduction
Recently I read the specification of [FDSN Web Services](https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/). 
In **Requests using the query method** section in [fdsnws-dataselect](https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/fdsnws-dataselect-1.1.pdf), there is a line which catches my curiosity:
> HTTP Digest Authentication (RFC 2617) should be requested from the client.
>
After reading this line, I started to browse some information, and to my surprice,
there are lots of HTTP Authentication methods existing in this world for solving
the problem of authentication. As a reminder, I will write some commonly-used
methods about HTTP authentication and list the pros and cons of each method.

## What's Authentication

## Type of Common HTTP Authentication
1. Basic
2. Digest

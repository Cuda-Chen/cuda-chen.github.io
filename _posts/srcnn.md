## Motivation
When I started to take my master degree, my professor told me to implement
with pure C++ and CUDA. After working for two months, I eventually finished
the first version but the result seems blurry.

However, I learned how to use pointer and basic CUDA concepts in this project.
As a revenge, I want to implement SRCNN from scratch, and this post is talking
about the note when doing on this project.

## What's SRCNN?

In this article, I am going to present a Virtual Youtuber
(VTuber) system just using ordinary CPU and webcam written in C++. 
I will also talk about the phenomenon of VTuber and some basics 
of gaze tracking. At last, I will leave some personal thoughts 
after working on this system.

## Introduction of VTuber
VTuber means a person streaming or uploading to YouTube with
an anime avatar follwing his movement in real-time. [1]
Though VTuber originated from mid-2010 in Japan, it started 
to boom from the beginning of 2020 with the help of COVID-19 
and the push of some commercial companies such as hololive [2] and 
nijisanji. [3]

## Chapter 1 How This Book Can Make You Invisible

### four levels of privacy

#### level one

Very basic, ecomoical moves that will give you more privacy tha 98 percent of other people.

#### level two

You utilities, your smartphones, and your other electronic devices will be in
alternate names. The license plates on your vehicles will not reveal your true name and address.
Anything confidential will be shredded.

#### level three

This will almost certainly require a move from your present location. Both your home (or
rental property) and your vehicles will be in the names of annonymous limited liability companies
(LLCs). Your home address will now be hidden from all but your closest relatives and friends.
What's more, your home address will no longer appear annual tax returns, or anywhere else.
You Internet/e-mail connections will be under cover if you follow the directions in chapter 12
, "E-mail and the Internet".

> Comments by myself: to this level you may not benefit from the service of current society
> such as credit cards and loans. Think twice before to this level.

#### level four

A dulication of the federal Witness Security Program fro criminals protected by the U.S.
government (of course it is illegal if you do this by your own).

> Comments by myself: you WILL give up all the benefits from nowadays society and you
> have no choice but ot keep running as the PI (private investigators) will find you if PI are willing to pay
> for unlimited resources.

#### advice by the author

- Start working on Level One even before you finish reading this book.
- In the weeks and months to come, raise yourself to Level Two.
- Raise to Level Three if you want to have fun.

### how to use this book

- ***Do not skip the next chapter.***
- You journey must begin with the first step: *seperating your name from your home address*.

## Chapter 2 Sepearate Your Name From Your Home Address

### take this immediate step to protect your mail

1. If your presently have a PO box, choose that address.
2. Have it sent on to your place of business if you have one, or perhaps to a friend who is in business.
3. Rent a box at a commercial mail-receving agency (CMRA).
4. Obtain a ghost address (of which more will be said later) in some faraway state or country and have the mail sent there.

### notes by me

- Though more and more services (such as third-party electrical payment service)
require an actual address, using a PO/CMRA box will still be a great idea as it
can seperate yourself and your living address.
- To receive goods or some formal mails such as lawsuit form, using a ghost
seems the first choice (though you may spend much more money as we need to
create an environment to let others to believe you actually lives in the
address).

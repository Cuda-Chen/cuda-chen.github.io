## Chapter 1 How This Book Can Make You Invisible

### four levels of privacy

#### level one

Very basic, ecomoical moves that will give you more privacy tha 98 percent of other people.

#### level two

You utilities, your smartphones, and your other electronic devices will be in
alternate names. The license plates on your vehicles will not reveal your true name and address.
Anything confidential will be shredded.

#### level three

This will almost certainly require a move from your present location. Both your home (or
rental property) and your vehicles will be in the names of annonymous limited liability companies
(LLCs). Your home address will now be hidden from all but your closest relatives and friends.
What's more, your home address will no longer appear annual tax returns, or anywhere else.
You Internet/e-mail connections will be under cover if you follow the directions in chapter 12
, "E-mail and the Internet".

> Comments by myself: to this level you may not benefit from the service of current society
> such as credit cards and loans. Think twice before to this level.

#### level four

A dulication of the federal Witness Security Program fro criminals protected by the U.S.
government (of course it is illegal if you do this by your own).

> Comments by myself: you WILL give up all the benefits from nowadays society and you
> have no choice but ot keep running as the PI (private investigators) will find you if PI are willing to pay
> for unlimited resources.

#### advice by the author

- Start working on Level One even before you finish reading this book.
- In the weeks and months to come, raise yourself to Level Two.
- Raise to Level Three if you want to have fun.

### how to use this book

- ***Do not skip the next chapter.***
- You journey must begin with the first step: *seperating your name from your home address*.

## Chapter 2 Sepearate Your Name From Your Home Address

### take this immediate step to protect your mail

1. If your presently have a PO box, choose that address.
2. Have it sent on to your place of business if you have one, or perhaps to a friend who is in business.
3. Rent a box at a commercial mail-receving agency (CMRA).
4. Obtain a ghost address (of which more will be said later) in some faraway state or country and have the mail sent there.

### notes by me

- Though more and more services (such as third-party electrical payment service)
require an actual address, using a PO/CMRA box will still be a great idea as it
can seperate yourself and your living address.
- To receive goods or some formal mails such as lawsuit form, using a ghost
seems the first choice (though you may spend much more money as we need to
create an environment to let others to believe you actually lives in the
address).

## Chapter 3 When Is a "Lie" Not a Lie?

> A Lie is a false statement made by one to another, who is entitled to hear
> and know the truth, and which false statement tends toward injury to the other.

> For author's guidelines:
> 1. Where no harm will be done, and no sworn oath is involved, I often give
> incurrect information. So does my wife.
> 2. I never give incorrect information if I am to sign a sworn statement,
> whether or not before a notary.
> 3. I may *withhold* information from the police or from government
> representative but I won't lie to them.
> 4. Under no condition whatsoever will I file a false tax return.

## Chapter 4 Mailboxes, Public and Private

Definition of public and private mailboxes:

- public: the boxes you can rent at a government postal service.
- private: commerical mail-receiving agencies (CMRAs).

### post-office boxes

If a choice is availabel, rent a box as far away from your home as is convenient for picking up mail once or twice a week. The ideal situation--often the case if you have a long commute to work--is to have the box in another town.

#### advantages

- First and formost, you avoid having to give out your street address.
- If you move to another location in the same area, there will be no changes to make for incoming mail.
- Your mail will be safe from thieves, no matter how long you leave it in the box.
- When you are on vacation, mail will not pile up at the mailbox at your home--a clear singla that the occupants are away.

#### disadvantages

- The process you have to go through such as filling forms with your legal name.

#### if you simply cannot move, ever

Rent a cheap apartment on a month-by-month basis, and live there just long enough to rent a box and have that address checked out. Then move back home, but *keep those rent receipts*.

> I have no idea about the "keep those rent receipts" means.
> Need to ask laywer in the future.

### other options for receiving mail at a PO box

If your friend or relative with the same last name, and he/she is agreeable, you could receive mail in their box. Most postal employees have more important duties than to check the first names of everyone in a family.

Another suggestion is to open the box in the name of a limited liability company (LLC), and here is the processes:

1. Rent a box in your own name, then you list your LLC.
2. Send yourself a few letters from time to time with address your LLC.
3. There may be no problem in receiving "your new name" even though the ending "LLC" is not included.

For total anonymity:

- Find someone whose mailbox you can take over. Either they are moving away or are poor enough so that a cash contribution will allow you to take over their box.
- Use this person's basic name--with a slight alteration--as if it were your own.

### commerical mail-receving agencies (CMRAS)

#### advantages

- Receive mail form private couriers and packages from PUS and FedEx.
- You will have a street address, which in some cases is necessary.
- You can often call in while traveling to have your mail sent on.
- They are often open longer.

#### disadvantages

- You will have to signa a "Private Mailbox (PMB) Rental Agreement" that includes a ea of small print. If an agent at the CMRA does not witness your signature, then it must be notarized.
- You will be required to furnish two from of identification such as photocopy of your picture.
- All major CMRA addresses are kept in commerical databases will may block in official use or order shipping from Internet.

#### possible remedies for private boxes

- Rent the box, then *move*, without telling the CMRA.
- Choose a mom-and-pop operation with a signle outlet.

### summary

If you do not plan to go beyond Level One security, get a private box at one of the CMRAs and have all your mail sent there.

For advanced security, however, the auther strongly suggest you to use a PO box if at all possible. What's more, let the PO box cannot connect you with your present home address. 

Use this box number for:

- Personal mail from relative and friends
- Bank statement
- Telephone, inscurance, and utility bills
- Social Security and Medicard (if applicable)
- Any other strictly personal mail

For everthing else--and especially if you receive mail in other names, use a private, alternate street address. This "ghost" address is the subject of the next chapter.

## Chapter 5 How to Obtain Your Own "Ghost" Address

A *ghost address* means to a fugure address you will use that is not in any database as a CMRA, and has no connection to where you really live.
What's more you may wish to have multiple ghost addresses.

### a partial list where alternate address will be used

1. The Internal Revenue Service.
2. Your driver's license.
3. All license for your pets (a PI's favorite search).
4. Hunting and fishing licenses.
5. Your voter's registration (if any).
6. Any membership records, such as with your church.
7. Your doctor, dentist, and chiropractor.
8. You attorney and accountant.
9. All LLCs used to title vehicles and real estate.
10. Cable TV (Another PI favorite! Make certain it's under another name).

### how to set up your own ghost address

#### older office building
An older office building which has several floors that neede renovation and had no tenants usually will fit your need. All the offices on those empty floors had mail slots in the doors. Even better, the building has multiple entrances on different streets and residentail aparment son the upper floors.

#### charity mission

> Charity missions, link the Salvation Army, often have people
> stay there for extended periods. They accept mail for residents
> so thay can get jobs, welfare, etc.

#### small motel

An independently run mom-and-pop motels may become your ghost
address if you dress well and pay them.

#### small-town pastor

> Give donation and get the address. Who's going to think about seeing what's in a small, unmarked box being shipped to a church?

### alternative sources for a ghost address

Check the Yelllow Pages for "Office Services," "Bookkeeping," etc.
Dont' call them, go in person. Discuss whatever service they offer, and then, as you're leaving, imitate the talk that whether it will be acceptable
to receive mail for any of your clients.

### should you allow anyone at your ghost address to know where you live?

Only you can answer that question. Hopefully, when you made the arrangements, you gave an address other than your own, and no telephone number. However, some PIs will make a deception to locate your address such as mocking himself as Fedex delivery.
There are two ways to protect yourself from this deception. One is to make sure that no one at your new address knows anything about you. The other is to use persons who, although they know you will positively protect you. If the latter, then amke sure to educate them about the various scams that may be used in an attempt to deceive them.

### now for the hard part

The hardest part of keeping your actual home address a secret is to educate your family to never, ever give out your home address to anyone other than relatives and close friends.

### your house number

If you delete the number on your house but still need to have others find it, you can tell your guests for a certain landmark or making some sign.

### a unique solution to hiding your home address

Buying a motor home under another name.

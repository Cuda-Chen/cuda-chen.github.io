## Chapter 1 How This Book Can Make You Invisible

### four levels of privacy

#### level one

Very basic, ecomoical moves that will give you more privacy tha 98 percent of other people.

#### level two

You utilities, your smartphones, and your other electronic devices will be in
alternate names. The license plates on your vehicles will not reveal your true name and address.
Anything confidential will be shredded.

#### level three

This will almost certainly require a move from your present location. Both your home (or
rental property) and your vehicles will be in the names of annonymous limited liability companies
(LLCs). Your home address will now be hidden from all but your closest relatives and friends.
What's more, your home address will no longer appear annual tax returns, or anywhere else.
You Internet/e-mail connections will be under cover if you follow the directions in chapter 12
, "E-mail and the Internet".

> Comments by myself: to this level you may not benefit from the service of current society
> such as credit cards and loans. Think twice before to this level.

#### level four

A dulication of the federal Witness Security Program fro criminals protected by the U.S.
government (of course it is illegal if you do this by your own).

> Comments by myself: you WILL give up all the benefits from nowadays society and you
> have no choice but ot keep running as the PI (private investigators) will find you if PI are willing to pay
> for unlimited resources.

## Chapter 1 How This Book Can Make You Invisible

### four levels of privacy

#### level one

Very basic, ecomoical moves that will give you more privacy tha 98 percent of other people.

#### level two

You utilities, your smartphones, and your other electronic devices will be in
alternate names. The license plates on your vehicles will not reveal your true name and address.
Anything confidential will be shredded.

#### level three

This will almost certainly require a move from your present location. Both your home (or
rental property) and your vehicles will be in the names of annonymous limited liability companies
(LLCs). Your home address will now be hidden from all but your closest relatives and friends.
What's more, your home address will no longer appear annual tax returns, or anywhere else.
You Internet/e-mail connections will be under cover if you follow the directions in chapter 12
, "E-mail and the Internet".

> Comments by myself: to this level you may not benefit from the service of current society
> such as credit cards and loans. Think twice before to this level.

#### level four

A dulication of the federal Witness Security Program fro criminals protected by the U.S.
government (of course it is illegal if you do this by your own).

> Comments by myself: you WILL give up all the benefits from nowadays society and you
> have no choice but ot keep running as the PI (private investigators) will find you if PI are willing to pay
> for unlimited resources.

#### advice by the author

- Start working on Level One even before you finish reading this book.
- In the weeks and months to come, raise yourself to Level Two.
- Raise to Level Three if you want to have fun.

### how to use this book

- ***Do not skip the next chapter.***
- You journey must begin with the first step: *seperating your name from your home address*.

## Chapter 2 Sepearate Your Name From Your Home Address

### take this immediate step to protect your mail

1. If your presently have a PO box, choose that address.
2. Have it sent on to your place of business if you have one, or perhaps to a friend who is in business.
3. Rent a box at a commercial mail-receving agency (CMRA).
4. Obtain a ghost address (of which more will be said later) in some faraway state or country and have the mail sent there.

### notes by me

- Though more and more services (such as third-party electrical payment service)
require an actual address, using a PO/CMRA box will still be a great idea as it
can seperate yourself and your living address.
- To receive goods or some formal mails such as lawsuit form, using a ghost
seems the first choice (though you may spend much more money as we need to
create an environment to let others to believe you actually lives in the
address).

## Chapter 3 When Is a "Lie" Not a Lie?

> A Lie is a false statement made by one to another, who is entitled to hear
> and know the truth, and which false statement tends toward injury to the other.

> For author's guidelines:
> 1. Where no harm will be done, and no sworn oath is involved, I often give
> incurrect information. So does my wife.
> 2. I never give incorrect information if I am to sign a sworn statement,
> whether or not before a notary.
> 3. I may *withhold* information from the police or from government
> representative but I won't lie to them.
> 4. Under no condition whatsoever will I file a false tax return.

## Chapter 4 Mailboxes, Public and Private

Definition of public and private mailboxes:

- public: the boxes you can rent at a government postal service.
- private: commerical mail-receiving agencies (CMRAs).

### post-office boxes

If a choice is availabel, rent a box as far away from your home as is convenient for picking up mail once or twice a week. The ideal situation--often the case if you have a long commute to work--is to have the box in another town.

#### advantages

- First and formost, you avoid having to give out your street address.
- If you move to another location in the same area, there will be no changes to make for incoming mail.
- Your mail will be safe from thieves, no matter how long you leave it in the box.
- When you are on vacation, mail will not pile up at the mailbox at your home--a clear singla that the occupants are away.

#### disadvantages

- The process you have to go through such as filling forms with your legal name.

#### if you simply cannot move, ever

Rent a cheap apartment on a month-by-month basis, and live there just long enough to rent a box and have that address checked out. Then move back home, but *keep those rent receipts*.

> I have no idea about the "keep those rent receipts" means.
> Need to ask laywer in the future.

### other options for receiving mail at a PO box

If your friend or relative with the same last name, and he/she is agreeable, you could receive mail in their box. Most postal employees have more important duties than to check the first names of everyone in a family.

Another suggestion is to open the box in the name of a limited liability company (LLC), and here is the processes:

1. Rent a box in your own name, then you list your LLC.
2. Send yourself a few letters from time to time with address your LLC.
3. There may be no problem in receiving "your new name" even though the ending "LLC" is not included.

For total anonymity:

- Find someone whose mailbox you can take over. Either they are moving away or are poor enough so that a cash contribution will allow you to take over their box.
- Use this person's basic name--with a slight alteration--as if it were your own.

### commerical mail-receving agencies (CMRAS)

#### advantages

- Receive mail form private couriers and packages from PUS and FedEx.
- You will have a street address, which in some cases is necessary.
- You can often call in while traveling to have your mail sent on.
- They are often open longer.

#### disadvantages

- You will have to signa a "Private Mailbox (PMB) Rental Agreement" that includes a ea of small print. If an agent at the CMRA does not witness your signature, then it must be notarized.
- You will be required to furnish two from of identification such as photocopy of your picture.
- All major CMRA addresses are kept in commerical databases will may block in official use or order shipping from Internet.

#### possible remedies for private boxes

- Rent the box, then *move*, without telling the CMRA.
- Choose a mom-and-pop operation with a signle outlet.

### summary

If you do not plan to go beyond Level One security, get a private box at one of the CMRAs and have all your mail sent there.

For advanced security, however, the auther strongly suggest you to use a PO box if at all possible. What's more, let the PO box cannot connect you with your present home address. 

Use this box number for:

- Personal mail from relative and friends
- Bank statement
- Telephone, inscurance, and utility bills
- Social Security and Medicard (if applicable)
- Any other strictly personal mail

For everthing else--and especially if you receive mail in other names, use a private, alternate street address. This "ghost" address is the subject of the next chapter.

## Chapter 5 How to Obtain Your Own "Ghost" Address

A *ghost address* means to a fugure address you will use that is not in any database as a CMRA, and has no connection to where you really live.
What's more you may wish to have multiple ghost addresses.

### a partial list where alternate address will be used

1. The Internal Revenue Service.
2. Your driver's license.
3. All license for your pets (a PI's favorite search).
4. Hunting and fishing licenses.
5. Your voter's registration (if any).
6. Any membership records, such as with your church.
7. Your doctor, dentist, and chiropractor.
8. You attorney and accountant.
9. All LLCs used to title vehicles and real estate.
10. Cable TV (Another PI favorite! Make certain it's under another name).

### how to set up your own ghost address

#### older office building
An older office building which has several floors that neede renovation and had no tenants usually will fit your need. All the offices on those empty floors had mail slots in the doors. Even better, the building has multiple entrances on different streets and residentail aparment son the upper floors.

#### charity mission

> Charity missions, link the Salvation Army, often have people
> stay there for extended periods. They accept mail for residents
> so thay can get jobs, welfare, etc.

#### small motel

An independently run mom-and-pop motels may become your ghost
address if you dress well and pay them.

#### small-town pastor

> Give donation and get the address. Who's going to think about seeing what's in a small, unmarked box being shipped to a church?

### alternative sources for a ghost address

Check the Yelllow Pages for "Office Services," "Bookkeeping," etc.
Dont' call them, go in person. Discuss whatever service they offer, and then, as you're leaving, imitate the talk that whether it will be acceptable
to receive mail for any of your clients.

### should you allow anyone at your ghost address to know where you live?

Only you can answer that question. Hopefully, when you made the arrangements, you gave an address other than your own, and no telephone number. However, some PIs will make a deception to locate your address such as mocking himself as Fedex delivery.
There are two ways to protect yourself from this deception. One is to make sure that no one at your new address knows anything about you. The other is to use persons who, although they know you will positively protect you. If the latter, then amke sure to educate them about the various scams that may be used in an attempt to deceive them.

### now for the hard part

The hardest part of keeping your actual home address a secret is to educate your family to never, ever give out your home address to anyone other than relatives and close friends.

### your house number

If you delete the number on your house but still need to have others find it, you can tell your guests for a certain landmark or making some sign.

### a unique solution to hiding your home address

Buying a motor home under another name.

## Chapter 6. RepairMen, Home Deliveries, FedED, UPS

### obtaining consent to tneter by deception

Why invite strangers into your home? Just say no, and
give the location of the nearest pay phone. Or you may
use the following two excuses:

1. "My husband tells me never to allow strangers into
the hose when he's not here".
2. "All we have is a cell phone and I lent it to my
father today.

### courier services such as FedEx and UPS

The only sure way to avoid having someone send you an
envelope or a package by courier is to never, ever,
let any other than your closest friends know where you
really live.

#### home delivery

Never allow your true name to be coupled with a delivery
to your home. If you feel that it is imperative to have
a delivery mode to where you really live, *it must not
be in your name*.

If, in fact, you have *ever* received a letter or package
at your present address under your real name, the only
way to protect your privacy is to move. Once this move
has bee made,then any futhre delivery must be in another
name. When you sign for the delivery, sign your *other*
name.
However, keep in mind for tex problem.

What's more, you may let the senders sign on the line of "
Release Signature. Sign to authorize delivery without 
obtaining signature", and when you see the FedEx truck
arrive, do not answer the door.

> My comment: this usuall won't be the case as
> there is no delivery option for Release Signature.

For picking up your goods at delivery office,
usually is not a good idea as the company requires
you to show your true name.

#### mail drop pickup

You can normally receive a shipment in CMRA (even though
you have not rented a box at the CMRA) in a business name
and no ID is necessary.

The following shows how to works:

1. You are going to send a small box.
2. You request your "friend to make a phone call to ask FedEx
or UPS whether it is acceptable to receive the box that
a "salesperson" will pick the box up and the reciver will be
your other names.
3. You then call your "friend"

### robber may intersonate the police

### pizza deliveries

Just no pizza deliveries.

### if your home address is already known, move

### note after reading chapter 6

1. As there are plenty of receiver proxy services
in the wild, is it possilbe to adopt these services
to receive your goods?

## Chapter 7 Untraeable Trash, Anonymous Utilities

### what yoru trash reveals about you

- bank statements
- telephone bills
- utility and other bills
- credit card and ATM receipts
- paycheck
- empty bottles for prescription medicine (with your doctor's name)
- personal and business letters; all address labels
- scraps of paper revealing a phone number or e-mail address.
- beer cans, wine, and liquor bottles
- anything to indicate drug use
- itemize grocery and pharmacy slips
- classfied ads from newspapers (to see if anything is circled)
- magazines, travel newspapers, or anything that would indicate interest in weapons or strange practices.

### utilities

For this book utilities means the companies that furnish electricity, grabage pickup, water and sewer connections, and natural or propane gas.

Never give yoru true name--much less your Social Seuciryt number or date of birth!--to a utility company, nor to any other private company that will furnish a service at yoru actual residence.

Rather, you should give your name as a fictitious one, or use your wife's madien name. Even then, this should just be her middle initial plus last name.
If the home is in the name of a limited liability company (see chapter 15), give each company the name of the LLC and insist that the name in the compny database is in the name of the LLC only.

A quick-and-dirty method of setting the utility accounts on short notice is to use a nominee (proxy), some who will act on yoru behalf (see chapter 13).For demanding a cash deposit for checking your credit, you can use a money order or a bank check for a deposit. Give them you "ghost" address (see chapter 5), explaining that (a) you do not have a mailbox at the street address, and (b) all bills are paid from your "business" (ghost) address.

### notes after reading chapter 7

- use cross shred to shred information

## Chapter 8 Your Social Security Number and Date of Birth

### your date of birth (DOB)

No matter how common your name, you can be quickly identified
in a database by coupling either your name *or* your birth date with your address.

If filling in a form yourself, you can just write "legal age". Anotehr alternatives is to
give a fictitious month and day, and a year a bit before or after the real one.
If you felel boligated to give a a date of birth, choose one that is easy to remember,
such as a national holiday.

### your social security number (SSN)

If you are asked for your SSN by any federal, state, or local government agency,
look for the Privacy Act Statuement. If it isn't there, ask to seeit before you give your number.

### your driver's license (DL)

Let's consider some of these private agencies or organizations:

#### your employer's demand for your DL, DOB, and SSN

- The ideal employer is you yourself.
- When you work for wages, tell the employer you will give 
your SSN if and when actually hired for the job.
- Do all within your power to give your employer only your
ghost address.
- Working as an independant contractor may be a great idea
yet you should consult a CPA.

#### hospitals and doctors

Remember, when a PI has an associate search for your records
in the Medical Information Bureau, many identical names
may come up. His first choice for picking you out will be
your date of birth, and his second choice will be whatever
address he may have for you (if any).

For nervous disorder, psychiatric problem, or sexually transmitted
disease, you should pay cash and use a false name. Better
yet, pop over into Canada and Mexico.

#### banks

Always use passport for identification.

#### renting an apartment

- Give all but not SSN.
- Dress well, be polite, use your passport for ID,
and offer to pay several months in advance.
  - Above all, prepare beforehand to explain the reason--perhaps
fear of a stalker--why you are simply unabel to allow any to have your SSN.
  - If you must furnish a copy of your tax return, black out
your SSN, and then (to make sure it cannot still be read
in front of a strong light) make a copy of that copy.
- If, at the present time, you see no way around acceding
to all of the landlord's demands, do not despair. Get a
short lease or rent month-by-month while you make your plans
to move on to a more private location.
- *Warning:* If you succeed in renting an apartment without
revealign your SSN, then never pay the rent with a personal check.
Insteal, pay either in cash or with a money order purchased
at a post office, a supermarket, or a convenience store.

#### renting a hose from its owner

Refer to *renting an apartment* section.

#### traver trailers and mobile homes

You may buy an older mobile home in a park and then fixing ti up while you live there.

#### real estate purchases and sales

- One is to never actually buy real estate.
- You can instead purchase and sell in the name of
a New Mexico limited liability company if you first
obtain a tax identification number (TIN).

#### false social security numbers

- Usually not a good idea.
- You give your true number but only when absolutely required,
or else no number at all.

#### obtaining credit

- If you want to be invisible, just don't obtain any personal credit.

#### run your life on a cash basis

If you truly wish to become invisible, never apply for personal credit.
(There is occasionally a business exception but credit in this case
should be extended only to your corporation or LLC).

### notes after reading chapter 8

- As some countries heavily utilize the SSN and eventually SSN leaks out in any scenes,
consider an alternative to against showing the SSN.
- Always showing your passport.
  - However, passport of some countries show SSN and date of birth,
consider an alternative of showing the passport.
- In some countries, obtaining credits is crucial for you to live,
consider an alternative to address this.

## Chapter 9 Your Alternate Names and Signatures

### if you say it's your signature, then it's your signature

- You can use any number of different signatures, including illegible ones.

### an alternate name

### titles

- DO NOT give advice.
- It is permissible to act the part.

### medical records

- Do tno give the doctor a complete medical history.
- Change your birht date and withhold your SSN lest for nessarity.
- Get off voter rolls and never return.

### web sites advertising fake ID

***Just don't use these services at all.***

## Chapter 10 Landline Telephones and Answering Machines

### telephone security

"Telephone security" is an oxymoron because a telephone conversation is never secure.

### unlisted numbers

An unlisted number is no longer the protection it used to be.
Many unlisted telephone numbers are now available on the Internet, and
reverse searches are available as well.

### how to list your name

Given that the name you give the telling company may show up on a database, do
your best to disguist it and try with the following methods:

- Wife's middle name and maiden name.
- Your middle name or initial, and last name.
- The name of a friend or relative (with a very common name) who is willing to have the phone
put in their middle/last or middle/maiden names.

Another system is to explain that your are a writer and that your telephone
number must be listed in your well-known *pen*. name.

If moving to a new area, I'd first spend an hour
or two with the local telephone directory, checking for the most
common names in the area.

### how not to answer the telephone

- A smple "Hello" or "Good moring" will suffice.
- Pratice beforehand.

### changing your listing

If your are not yet willing or able to move to new location, you
may still contact the telephone company to say your are moving
away.

Then, after few days or weeks later, order a new telephone, which will
of course have a different number. If you areusing someone else
to do this for your, have him or her make the call. This person will
*not* admit to having had service before, nor will a SSN be given.

Next, play the payment with cash deposit, and pay your bills on time.

### cordless phones

Usually don't use this as your comminucation is always compromised.

### the telephone at the other end

When you make a sensitive call, make sure the person at the
other end is on a secure line, or just meet him/her in person.

### "hacker-proof" answering machines

There is no such thing, period.

### calls to 911

When you call 911, your true address shows up on the operator's
monitor, along with whatevern name your telephone service is
under.

You can use the following three techniques:

1. Use a cell phone to call to 911.
2. Call a friend who will in turn call 911 from his/her home.
3. Give your ghost address, adding that you are just housesitting
for a friend when the emergency came up.

### watch our for this sneaky trick

When a call comes in from a sensitive party, and
there is some confusion about who called whom, *ask*. if neither
called the other, you have just had a heads up that someone is
after one or both of you.

### questions

- In the case of a life-or-death situation where neither privacy
nor legality matter, what is the fastest way to get help?
  - Call tierh the fire department or 911 and report a fire in prog-
ress.
  - "At a time like this you can't really worry about legal niceties. There's
not much point in being completely law-abiding if you're dead."

## Chapter 11 Smartphones, Dumbphones, Pagers

### how to tcontents of your cell Phone may be revealed

#### if arrested, your iPhone, blackberry, or android smartphone will be searched

#### crossing a border?

Make sure your phone does not contain any illegal in the local country.

#### trying to hide your home address from a level two or level three PI?

Ping your phone and it will locate itself.

### your voice-mail boxes can be hacked.

Even *with* passwords, some Level Three PIs may be able to
get your nessages, but using a password will usually protect you
against the lower levels.

### think you can hide from your intimate partner?

Always no way.

### identities can be relevaed via facial recognition and facebook

Based solely on their face and information gathered online, we can
get your real names of members of an online dating site who'd used false names.

### smartphones are more vulnerable than previously thought

> Comment: taking HTC as example. Just remember smartphones
> are more vulnerable, period.

### life without a smartphone

- To by a cell phone, give provider a bank cashier's check for a $1,000 security
deposit (without SSN), your middle and last name.
- Leave a remote address and paid from there for your bill.
- Only turn on cell phone if your are expecting a call.
- Enable password on your voice mail.
- Buy your phone from service provider A and activate your phone with
service provider B.

### prepaid cell phones

### use a pager with your cell phone

The best way to use your pager is in conjunction with a cell
phone that is not turned on. If you receive a message that ap-
peras urgent, either turn your cell phone on just long enough to
reply, or go to a pay phone.
What's more, use a set of code to represent what callee should
do.

### notes by me

- Some countries discontinue pager.
- Some countries require your SSN even you try to grab a prepaid cell phones.
  - However, a oversea roaming prepaid card with alternate ID may win.
- Some countries has a few of service provider.

## Chapter 12 E-mail and the Internet

### the story of Paul Peters

#### if your are ever forced to run, for any reason

- Never write a secret message using Microsoft Word.
- Never use e-mail for a secret message.
- Never use a library or a video store to check your e-mail.
- Never use a vehicle registered in your own name.

### even a strong password may not protect you

#### lessons learned

1. If a hacker wishes to get into your e-mail account, your
password will not matter to him, he will plan to get around it.
2. First he will search the Internet for any scrap of informa-
tion about you.
3. Then he will access your account up to the point of pass-
word entry, where he'll click on "ForgOt your password?"
4. Using information he's previously gathered about you, he'll
go to work by guessing the answers.

#### how to protect yourself

Make a tough one question of your own if you are allowed to
do so. Otherwise, use false information (and keep track
of it somewhere safe).

### e-mail is never secure

Always use e-mail with SSL and HTTPS enabled.

What's more, you can enable message encryption for better safety.

If you're sending confidentail information, check these methods
before sending:

1. Make sure you have a strong unique password guarding
your account.
2. Use extreme care to avoid spyware and keyloggers.
3. Make sure the recipients apply the above two methods.

### "This message will self-destruct" (TMWSD)

### your Internet service provider

### Internet dangers

*you can live without the Internet*. Event with it, never
forget that the Internet is a mysterious and highly dangerous
place.

### Internet scams

- Never open an incoming attachment unless it is not only
from someone you know, but also you are either expecting it or
there is a valid explaination in the message that accompa-
nies it.
- Never, ever, click on a link that is contained in an unsolic-
ited e-mail from an unknown source.

### how to check out a date or a mate

#### use search engines

#### if he sent you an photo, check it out

#### avoid free dating sites

#### be especially wary of religious dating sites

May of the LDS Web site include excellent advice for Mor-
mom singles who wish to meet other Mormons online. They are
told to never give out personal information. They are warned
never to believe everything they are told, even if it comes
from other LDS Web sites. Here is a typical warning:

> Ask for references, especially of family, other LDS dating friends,
> coworkers, or even their bishop. If you telephone one of their
> references, use a pay phone to avoid problems with caller ID.
> Never meet alone; always bring a friend. Even for LDS dating,
> make sure that you meet in a public place during the day, like a
> mall, park, or restaurant.

### three basic rules

1. Do not click on any ads you see ona Web site.
2. Never enter accurate information into your computer or
on a Web site, and especially not for an e-mail account.
3. When you sign up for whatever, use different name, a dif-
ferent username, and a different password each time.

### my favorite quote

> Don't write anything you can phone.
> Don't phone anything you can talk.
> Don't talk anything you can whispter.
> Don't whispter anything you can smile.
> Don't smile anything you can nod.
> Don't nod anything you can wink.

### questions & answers

#### Is there any simple way to remember complicated passwords?

You can use the first and last letter of the service's domain name
you are going to log into, then combine with a base strong password
(say "RJK&r2d" for example) in any position. You just need to
remember only "one" password.

## Chapter 13 How to Locate A Trustworthy Nominee

### advertise on craigslist

### how to interview

- The people that read the book and website of *How to Be Invisible*.
- The people will assist you to do at least the followings:
  - Rent a PO box.
  - Order cable TV.
  - Sign up for all utilities.
  - Obtain a cell phone.

### how much to pay the nominee

### how to maintain your own privacy

- Do not give a nominee your true last name, your age, your date
or birth, or your previous address. This is a *business* arrangement.

### my own options as to using a stranger for a nominee

- Use longtime friends as nominee.
- Advertise on Craigslist.
- Lend the candidate *How to Be Invisible*.
- Get the password from candidate then run Internet checks for
  - criminal history
  - check
  - Intelius
- After setting up well, give a one-time flat-rate fee, plus
an annual fee for providing service for nominee.

### protect yourself with a written argeement

### the absolute worst fear for even a level three PI

## Chapter 14 Bank Accounts and Money Transfers

### unintended consequences

### your personal bank account

Since this book is about privacy measures rather than tax
evasions, you need have no secrets from the government.

### use a nominee

### rubber signature stamps

### print your own checks

### or, no bank account at all

### another good reason to pay cash

### untraceable money transfers

Use the postal service to mail the cash. 

#### how to invisibly transfer #25,000

Obtain fifty business-size (#10) envelopes and the same number
of first-class postage stamps. Pick up a magazine with lots of 
small picturres and price lists in the back (in particular, 
photography magazines are ideal). Into each envelope insert
five $100 bills. Wrap then in one page from the magazine.
This will weight fourteen grams, whcih is just half an ounce.
If possible, mail the envelopes from various locations over
a period of days or weeks and--if available--to multiple address.
Remember, use normal first-class maiil. Even with the cost of
stamps and envelopes, this will not cost you than $25. (I
recommend you not to register the envelopes. That might attract
too much attention.)

#### mailing money overseas

Remember you may be considers as "structuring", which is illegal.

> Note by myself: nowdays, it is not possible to send money
> via postal service.

### *hawala* banking

The *hawala* system has been under attack since 9/11 and by
the time you read this it may be illegal in many countries.
However, it does make for interesting conversations among
friends. Beyond that, proceed at your own risk.

### how not to have a secret account revealed

- Use a different bank.
- Given a ghost address when you open the account.
- List a secret voice-mail number that only you can access.
 
## Chapter 15 New Mexico Limited Liability Companies

### what's the characteristics of an LLC (by author)

1. No one will know who owns it unless the owner tells them.
2. It will be filed on New Mexico--a state that protects privacy
and does not require an annual report.
3. It will be managed by a *single member*.
4. When used (such as buying a vehicle or real estate), it will
list a ghost address as the principal place of business.
5. It will cost about $100 to form, and less than $100 a year
for the resident agent (a minimum of three years is normally
paid ahead).
6. The LLC name will never appear on a state or federal tax
return.

### what is an LLC?

Like a corporation, it is a legal entity that stands
alone, but it lacks the many onerous bookkeeping details and
annual meetings required of a corporation.

### income tax consequences

Since the IRS treats one-member LLCs as sole proprietorships
for tax purposes, there are no income tax consequences.

### proof of ownership

The best way to prove ownership, then, is to have the original LLC
ducoments compled with an operating agreement.
Yet, this is a specialized field so author suggests check
with an attorney.

## Chapter 20 Secret Spaces, Hidden Places

### never hide cash in the master bedroom

- The average burglar will be inside your home for less than ten minutes.
Your goal, therefore, is to keep your cash hidden for more than that length of time.
  - As such, the burglar usually straights up to your master bedroom.
- By author, the "can safes" are ideal.

### where to hide other items of various sizes

#### small

Save old junk-mail envelopes and put a few $50 or $100 bills in
each one. Hide the envelopes in such places as:

- Sheet music in a piano bench.
- In the box of old tax receipts in a storage unit.
- In the hollowed-out section of an out-of-date software
manual
- In one of the hanging files in a file cabinet
- Rolled up and inserted into a "foot power" spray can with
a removable bottom.


When travelling, you can use a slim dree belt with two sections, each of
which will hold three bills folded lengthwise four times. Then, put some
notes in it (do not exceed the limitation of any country!).

For outdoor mildew and rustproof storage, nothing beats silver and gold.

#### medium

Keep these things in private storage, and in case of death, your trusted
friends will clean out the unit and dispose of the contents.

#### large

A three-drawer fireproof file cabinet is best stored in a secret room
that will hopefully be large enough to hold at most two persons.
The only hisitation is that the secret room would be common knowledge among
the architect, the contractor, and the workers. Alsa, the building plans
would be on file with the city or county.

### speaking of buried treasure ...

No one ever knows it before digging :)

## How to Secretly Run a Home-based Business

When it comes to working at home without registering for a business license,
consider yourself warned.

Keep these tips in mind:

- Never, ever tall your neighbors about your business.
- Do not have your customers or clients come to your home.
- Never receive delivers at home--but then, you already kew that. The best invisible
buciness is run online. Paymetns can be either online or money orders received in
the mail. No one will know your age, race, background, or if you're a first cousin
to the Roswell aliens.

### how to hide both your true name and your sex when you run an Internet business

- When phone calling (say you call yourself "John"):
  - "John is not here today, but I can solve your problem".
  - Pretexting as follow if client insists calling Joon: "Unfortunately, sir, John
is completely deaf, which is why he uses only -email or snail mail. But he sures
knows a lot about his subject, doesn't he!"

### should you work "off the books"?

If you mean avoid paying income tax, then the answer is no.

### anonymous profits in real estate

- You purchase the mobile home for *cash*, so no one asks you for credit information.
- You title it in the name of a LLC.
- The renters will either pay cash each month, or make their checks out to whatever
name you give them.

### invisible profile

In general, the idea behind running any low-profile business is to keep your name out
of the picture. Aside any alternate names, you can use *two* LLCs, with the first one
doing business and the second one as the sole member of the first.

A totally different method is to use one or more established businesses as a "front".
Suppose that you wish to set up an invisible, untraceable business, and for whatever
reason do not want ot use a corporation, an LLC, nor a nominee, you can follow these
steps:

1. Locate retail businesses or public offices where the owners are willing to act on
your behalf in return for a commission. Contact them in person or via a representative.
Your business could be in repair, replacement, software, small products, information,
reports, or any other kind of business where *the customer would contact the store
or office*.
2. Checks will be made out to your dealers, and the dealers will pay you or your rep
in cash. They will want a receipt for their tax records, but this can be in any business
name you like (who would ever check?).
3. You keep good records with QuickBooks (no audit trail when you correct errors), list
the income on your personal tax return (Schedule C), and all's well with your world.

## Chapter 22 The Dangers of Facial Recognition

### can facial recognition be defeated?

Perhaps, but only with extreme effort. Facial recognition works by measuring the distance
from you eyes to another point on your face, and it will become more difficult if you:

- Wear a baseball cap.
- Wear tinted or dark glasses.
- Have facial hair.
- Have on dark eyeliner.
- Wear a ski mask (you wish!).
- Smile (it distorts the biometrics).

If you are determined to post a picture of yourself anywhere on the Internet, you might
consider a picture showing your profile, thus hiding your key measurements. Or, use a
photograph where your head is just a small part of the picture, such as my own picture
on the dust jacket of this book.

## Some thoughts

### Alternative Identity
- It is said that a Vanuatu PR only costs less than 100,000 USD. Maybe this is
a choice.
- How about a Panama LLC?

### Cell Phones
- For phone call without cell phone, Viber (Out) or Google Voice or vowifi
maybe a great choice.
- [T-Deck Pro](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-deck-pro), used as a pager,
might be a great choice. However, consider the Chip is originated from China
(ESP32).

> You need to transfer your domain to a registrar that provides Whois privacy. For that to work, the registrar must support your top level domain, and you must unlock the domain before transfer.
> However, be aware that if whois privacy isn't used from the start, and when the domain was registered, your whois data, including the ttansfer, can be looked up via domain history.
> To be protected 100%, I would dump the domain, and register a new one with a registrar that provides Whois privacy. Namecheap does it for free.
